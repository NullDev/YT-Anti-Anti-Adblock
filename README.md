<p align="center"><b>Simplistic user-script to remove YouTube's "Adblockers are not allowed" popup.</b></p>
<hr>

## :question: What does it do?

It automatically closes the anti-adblock popups and un-pauses (or loads) the video for you. <br>
Hopefully even fast enough so that you don't even notice ðŸ˜¸

- It removes the closable "Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube" popup.
- It removes the closable three-strikes popup.
- And it removes the **non-closable** "Ad blockers violate YouTube's Terms of Service".
- It also supports playlists and timestamps and stuff.
- Oh and the script auto updates. Which is neat. I guess.

**Note:** This is _not_ a replacement for your Ad-Blocker.

## :question: Why not use xyz?

Existing solutions either didn't work (e.g. a semi transparent window was still there and scrolling was disabled) or they were overkill (e.g. a complete youtube-only adblocker) or they only killed one type of popup.

Hence: âœ¨ Youtube Anti-Anti-Adblock âœ¨

## ðŸ’» Development

If you're interested in helping out (thanks!): 
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NullDev/YT-Anti-Anti-Adblock.git`
- Open it in your favourite IDE
- Install the dependencies for linting with `npm i`
- [Link the script in Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q402)

Basically, in your Tampermonkey dashboard you create a new script that looks like this: 

```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name         YouTube Anti-Anti-Adblock
// @namespace    yt-anti-anti-adblock
// @version      1.1.0
// @description  Remove the "ad blockers are not allowed on youtube" popup.
// @author       NullDev
// @license      MIT
// @match        *://*.youtube.com/*
// @homepageURL  https://github.com/NullDev/YT-Anti-Anti-Adblock
// @icon         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NullDev/YT-Anti-Anti-Adblock/master/icon.png
// @grant        none
// @run-at       document-idle
// @require      file://C:/Users/XXX/PATH/TO/REPOSITORY/YT-Anti-Anti-Adblock/yt-anti-anti-adblock.user.js
// ==/UserScript==
```

Pay attention to the `// @require` line and edit the path accordingly.
- Windows: `file://C:/.../...` 
- Linux: `file:///.../...`)

Then make sure the Tampermonkey extension [has permissions for file paths](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q204). <br>
And finally, just code in your IDE and Tampermonkey will autoupdate it. 

Now all thats left to do is grab an [open issue](https://github.com/NullDev/YT-Anti-Anti-Adblock/issues) and start coding. ðŸ˜¸
