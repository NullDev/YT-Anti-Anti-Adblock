## :question: What does it do?

It automatically closes the anti-adblock popups and un-pauses (or loads) the video for you. <br>
Hopefully even fast enough so that you don't even notice 😸

- It removes the closable "Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube" popup.
- It removes the closable three-strikes popup.
- And it removes the **non-closable** "Ad blockers violate YouTube's Terms of Service".
- Oh and the script auto updates. Which is neat. I guess.

**Note:** This is _not_ a replacement for your Ad-Blocker.

## :question: Why not use xyz?

Existing solutions either didn't work (e.g. a semi transparent window was still there and scrolling was disabled) or they were overkill (e.g. a complete youtube-only adblocker) or they only killed one type of popup.

Hence: ✨ Youtube Anti-Anti-Adblock ✨
