## :question: What does it do?

It automatically closes the "Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube" popup and un-pauses the video for you. <br>
Hopefully even fast enough so that you don't even notice ðŸ˜¸

**Note:** This is _not_ a replacement for your Ad-Blocker.

It literally only closes the popup. And unpauses the video. Uh, yea. <br>
Oh and the script auto updates. Which is neat. I guess.

## :question: Why not use xyz?

Existing solutions either didn't work (e.g. a semi transparent window was still there and scrolling was disabled) or they were overkill (e.g. a complete youtube-only adblocker).

Hence: âœ¨ Youtube Anti-Anti-Adblock âœ¨
